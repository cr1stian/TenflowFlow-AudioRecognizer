# TenflowFlow-AudioRecognizer
First crack at using TensorFlow to become more familiar with Machine Learning.
  This Audio Recognizer allows one to create models of sounds by holding down either the <i>Left, Right, Noise</i> buttons. This will build a model using the data sample that is about ~73ms of the sound/tone. To then be able to hit train and let the magic happen. Once it's done train, clicking the <i>Listen</i> button will allow you to move the slider LEFT or RIGHT depending on the sound/tone you chose to gather data from.
